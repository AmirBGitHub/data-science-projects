# Guideline

Projects 1: After cloning/downloading the repository and extracting the ZIP file and executing command 'python main.py' in the first level directory, it will be able to generate all the results and plots used in the PDF report and print them out in a clear manner.

Project 2: After cloning/downloading the repository run the 'Klaviyo exercise.py' file to get the statistical analysis results for customer data.

# Project 1

The purpose of this project was to calculate some statistics and probability concepts using the data of ranking for US universities in CS with four criteria of CS ranking based on US news, the value of Research Overhead, Admin Base Pay, and Out-of-state Tuition. 

In addition, the probability of the variables have been determined and, by considering the correlation between each variable and constructing a Bayesian network, this probability has been improved by obtaining a higher probability for the variables in terms of log-likelihood.

# Project 2 

The attached CSV file lists the customer, date, and dollar value of orders placed at a store in 2017. The gender of each customer is also provided.

The Python code will do the following:

A) Assemble a dataframe with one row per customer and the following columns:
- customer_id
- gender
- most_recent_order_date
- order_count (number of orders placed by this customer)

B) Plot the count of orders per week.

C) Compute the mean order value for gender 0 and for gender 1 and determine the significance of difference.
